# ddf_project
Data-driven-forecasting model applied to a single neuron. The project is based on this paper: [Reduced-Dimension, Biophysical Neuron Models Constructed From Observed Data](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/34/7/1545/111332/Reduced-Dimension-Biophysical-Neuron-Models). An extra artificial neural network is added to the model to include time-delay embedded current in the forecast.
