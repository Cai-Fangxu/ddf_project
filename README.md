# ddf_project
Data-driven-forcasting model applied to a single neuron. The project is based on this paper [https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01515](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/34/7/1545/111332/Reduced-Dimension-Biophysical-Neuron-Models). An extra artificial neural network is added to the model to include time-delay embedded current in the forcasting.
